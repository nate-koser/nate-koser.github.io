<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I like how there were no surprises because everything was on the syllabus.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked Mr. Koser&#039;s interest in the course material and the speed at which we go over different concepts. As a recitation, I felt it was taught well and helped me with questions I had during the lecture. I liked the organizational aspect of this course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how I had a recitation for &quot;Intro to Ling Theory.&quot; I was able to learn about topics discussed in lectures in great detail. The recitations also greatly helped me with homework assignments, as we would go over a lot of practice problems and we were able to ask questions in a small setting. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor was very nice and a fair grader when he knew we were all panicking. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I learned a lot about linguistics and the material is very fascinating to me.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The fact that it was simple and easy, I never was overwhelmed with the subject material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how different this course was than any other course I have taken before.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Instructor went out of his way to help students</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The lectures and how this subject relates to something we do understand, but dives way deeper into the science and patterns of it.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I would make the homework and powerpoints align more because so many time I couldn&#039;t do the homework because it made no sense to me.  Maybe doing more practice problems in recitation would help rather than asking homework questions the last 5 minutes of class.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would start with giving work sheets from the beginning of the recitation. These worksheets really helped me understand the material and have a clear cut vision of the material I need to know.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Give out more handouts, which he ended up doing and helped tremendously.... literally so helpful.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I believe this course was taught very well and wouldn&#039;t change anything.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>My TA was absolutely horrendous. I would actively want to avoid going to class/recitation just because he continually made the material more confusing and often got the crux of the information wrong. I cannot recommend against him enough.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>nothing!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would research more on the topic for trying to teach it </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If I were teaching the course, I would try and prepare myself with every possible question a student might have. Since this course teaches a subject where every answer is unanswered, we received a lot of &quot;I don&#039;t know&quot;s as answers.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>They have taught with great interest themselves, therefore engaging the rest of the students. The worksheets also helped my understanding of the material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Taking this course has inspired me to learn more about this subject.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor doesn&#039;t exactly encourage my specific growth or progress but he allowed me to skirt on by without worrying too much about the nuances of technique or lessons. Ultimately the class was neutral there was no real new knowledge gained, just simply a codification of ideas I had figured out since I was 5. Thankfully I never felt inhibited by the professor, the only issue was the TA</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>our TA really helped us out a lot this semester between giving us worksheets and study material that helped us to better understand the material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>This course helped me understand the subject I want to go into. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Tips: Try and improve on directly answering the question asked rather than finding abstract ways to do it. The professor in lecture has clear cut examples and a much simpler way of stating concepts, which make them easier to understand.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>n/a</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>You always tried to answer everyone&#039;s questions and ensure we understood the material, even though some questions had definitely been answered before. Thanks for putting so much care into the class and giving us all those handouts too, they were extremely useful. 10/10 TA again.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>There are students in this class who didn&#039;t know what a part of speech was and to ask them to then decipher linguistic meaning from words and sentences was a hilariously and often times infuriating task. It was compounded with a TA who was so woefully unprepared that tuning him out would have been a greater help to all than his presence in the classroom. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>overall even though this class was a little difficult for me, I really enjoyed learning the material and the professor and TA were great and easy to talk to which is very helpful.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
